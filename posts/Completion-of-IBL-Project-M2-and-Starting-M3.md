Vathes has successfully completed Milestone 2 of our contract with the [International Brain Laboratory (IBL)](https://www.internationalbrainlab.com/), where we developed data pipelines to handle the core mouse and behavioral information collected through IBL projects. In Milestone 3, Vathes will continue to develop and extend the data pipeline, and we are excited to be developing a web interface to support intuitive navigation of the massive behavioral and electrophysiological data collected by IBL.
