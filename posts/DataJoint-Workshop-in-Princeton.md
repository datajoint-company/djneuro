Vathes conducted a 3 day DataJoint workshop at Princeton as part of our continued involvement with Princeton U19 project {% post_link "Princeton-Neuroscience-Institute-Partners-with-Vathes-to-Support-the-Adoption-of-DataJoint" "U19 project" %}. We were excited to cover topics ranging from DataJoint introduction, infrastructure setup and management as well as hands-on design and implementation of data pipelines. Vathes will continue to be involved in Princetonâ€™s U19 project, providing support on data pipeline development and deployment.
