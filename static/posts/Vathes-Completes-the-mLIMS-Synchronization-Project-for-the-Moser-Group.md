Working closely with [Moser group](https://www.ntnu.edu/kavli/research/moser) and [BIOINFORX](https://bioinforx.com/) developers, Vathes completed the design of a DataJoint data pipeline to represent data stored in mLIMS and developed a utility to continuously synchronize data entered into [mLIMS]((https://bioinforx.com/lims2/product_mlims.php) into the DataJoint pipeline.
