Vathes conducted a 3 day DataJoint workshop at Princeton as part of our continued involvement with Princeton [U19 project](/post?id=Princeton-Neuroscience-Institute-Partners-with-Vathes-to-Support-the-Adoption-of-DataJoint). We were excited to cover topics ranging from DataJoint introduction, infrastructure setup and management as well as hands-on design and implementation of data pipelines. Vathes will continue to be involved in Princetonâ€™s U19 project, providing support on data pipeline development and deployment.
