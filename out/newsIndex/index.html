With the goal of promoting reproducibility and interoperability of neuro toolsets, Vathes has worked closely with community leaders and tool builders and is committed to multiple upcoming interoperability efforts. Specifically, Vathes engineers have worked closely with NWB developers to outline a practical and effective pathway for enabling export capabilities  from DataJoint pipelines into NWB 2.0 files. Furthermore, we are very excited to start an interoperability project with the Gigantum team, in which a DataJoint pipeline can be configured to be used as an input to a Gigantum project. \n","data":{"title":"Neuro Reproducibility Hackashop","layout":"postNew.pug","date":"2019-03-08T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["DataJoint","NeuroNex"],"categories":["News"]},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},"slug":"Neuro-Reproducibility-Hackashop"},{"document":{"content":"\n![alt text](./static/posts/Completion-of-IBL-Project-M2-and-Starting-M3/IBL%20logo.png \"IBL Logo\")\nVathes has successfully completed Milestone 2 of our contract with the [International Brain Laboratory (IBL)](https://www.internationalbrainlab.com/), where we developed data pipelines to handle the core mouse and behavioral information collected through IBL projects.
