## How to build
Don't forget to run `node prebuild.js` to build the appropriate news posts in to the `/post` folder inside `pages`

Put the markdown news post files inside the `markdowns` folder. The filename before `.md` will also be the path to the post on the website

`npm run build` `npm run export` then `http-server -p 8080` to test the static export
