DataJoint Neuroâ€™s scientists Thinh Nguyen and Edgar Y. Walker visited the [Moser Lab](https://www.ntnu.edu/kavli/research/moser) at Trondheim, Norway to hold a DataJoint workshop. The workshop featured a DataJoint pipeline for electrophysiology and behavioral tracking, built in collaboration with the Moser team, and showcased the workflow surrounding this pipeline. The pipeline is expected to launch for production by the end of October!
