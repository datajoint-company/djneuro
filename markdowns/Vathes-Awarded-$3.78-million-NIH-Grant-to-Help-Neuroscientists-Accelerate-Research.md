**__[Press Release__]** Vathes LLC, the Houston-based data solutions developer currently working with neuroscience research labs across North America and Europe, was awarded a $3.78 million grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH)’s Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies ([BRAIN](https://braininitiative.nih.gov/)) Initiative, a large-scale effort to accelerate neuroscience research.”

The funding will allow Vathes to implement its **"DataJoint Pipelines for Neurophysiology"** Project, designed to make open-source solutions for data science and engineering more accessible to researchers leading groundbreaking neurophysiology studies.

It also opens the door for the company to enter a new phase in assisting neuroscience research with its **DataJoint® Neuro** platform and suite of services. These solutions, known as DataJoint pipelines, enable scientists to streamline the acquisition of complex data, as well as more effectively analyze and visualize the data generated in collaborative experiments.

The project will also foster the integration of best practices from leading neuroscience research teams. For example, it will ease the adoption of advanced data science solutions by a broader cohort of research teams by publishing curated modules integrated with training materials.

The project's Principal Investigator, Dr. Dimitri Yatsenko (Vathes VP of Research and Development) pointed out, "I am excited about leading this project as it will lower barriers for research teams in conducting complex multi-modal experiments. It will help establish more rigorous practices for managing and sharing big and complex data and computations across the board."

The grant, administered through the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke (NINDS), is another important step forward for Vathes since the project will help accelerate expanding its offers beyond current partners and clients.

Vathes CEO Dr. Edgar Y. Walker said, "Over the past three years, we've diligently worked with diverse neuroscience teams to support more effective collaboration by ensuring data integrity and lowering the complexity of data management in very dynamic settings. Vathes, which is made up of an impressive team of experienced systems neuroscientists, data scientists, and software developers, has hit the road running and is in full development mode."

This project is supported by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke of the National Institutes of Health under Award Grant Number 1U24NS116470-01.
