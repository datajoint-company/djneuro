Dimitri Yatsenko and Edgar Y. Walker travelled to Princeton Neuroscience Institute (PNI) to run a two-day introductory workshop on how to build neuroscience data pipelines using DataJoint. Approximately fifty researchers involved with the [Princeton U19 program](https://www.princeton.edu/news/2017/10/24/seven-princeton-researchers-receive-nih-brain-initiative-awards) attended the workshop. On the first day, Dimitri and Edgar covered the basic principles and concepts of DataJoint. On day two, they covered applied examples, and the participants translated an existing project into the DataJoint pipeline with support from the instructors.
