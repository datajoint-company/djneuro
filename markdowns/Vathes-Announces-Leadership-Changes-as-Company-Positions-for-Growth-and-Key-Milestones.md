**__[Press Release__]** Vathes LLC, the Houston-based data solutions developer working with scientists to accelerate their research, is announcing changes in its leadership as the company
positions itself for growth and key milestones.

The three-year old company is entering a new phase in supporting groundbreaking neuroscience
research with its **DataJoint® Neuro** platform and services, including the pending announcement of a
major federally funded endeavor that will result in the platform’s adoption by a broader cohort of
neuroscience labs across the U.S. and internationally.

The Member Board of Vathes LLC appointed Edgar Y. Walker as the company&#39;s Chief Executive Officer
effective immediately. Dr. Walker has been a driving force in major projects since the company was
founded. His broad technical expertise and leadership abilities will ensure the company&#39;s performance
and delivery on projects going forward.

Dimitri Yatsenko, who served as President since the company began operations over three years ago,
will focus his efforts as Vice President of Research and Development. He is working closely with Dr.
Walker for a smooth transition, while also filling the role of Principal Investigator for the company’s
pending key projects.

Details about the major federally funded endeavor will be announced within the next few weeks, pending
required approvals.
