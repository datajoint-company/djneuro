DataJoint NEURO team attended SfN 2019, presenting the DataJoint pipeline design for the International Brain Lab (IBL), where a cloud-based data pipeline was built to facilitate collaboration and data sharing between 21 labs across the globe. The design is publicly available at https://github.com/int-brain-lab/IBL-pipeline. 

We also summarized the outcome of the DataJoint-NWB interoperability project with Janelia Research Campus, and introduced the concept design for DataJoint canonical pipelines for neurophysiology, visit https://github.com/vathes/DataJoint-NWB-showcase for more details.
