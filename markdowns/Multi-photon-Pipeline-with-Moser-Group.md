Vathes is thrilled to extend the ongoing project with Moser group from Kavli institute to now support the development and extension of multi-photon imaging data pipelines, in addition to the continued involvement and development of the electrophysiology pipeline in freely behaving animals. The pipeline aims to seamlessly connect data acquisition, pre-processing, and behavioral analysis.
