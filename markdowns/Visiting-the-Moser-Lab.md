DataJoint Neuroâ€™s scientists Thinh Nguyen and Edgar Y. Walker visited the [Moser Lab](https://www.ntnu.edu/kavli/research/moser) at Trondheim, Norway, embarking on a new project of designing comprehensive DataJoint pipeline for electrophysiology and behavioral tracking of freely moving animals. The pipeline is designed to handle and unify multiple types of recording systems and tracking systems. The pipeline will also capture a scientific workflow, from data recording, spike clustering using various techniques to data analyses and reporting. We are extremely honored and excited to start on this challenging project!
