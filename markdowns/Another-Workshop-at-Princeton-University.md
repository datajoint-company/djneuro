DataJoint NEURO's data scientist Shan Shen conducted a workshop at Princeton University from 1/29/2020 to 1/31/2019. Shan gave an overview of the current status of the data management system within the U19 team and performed a tutorial on the current U19 DataJoint behavioral pipeline. It is exciting to see that more users within the Princeton U19 team started to adopt DataJoint. The next phase will continue on the development of the imaging pipeline and the visualization tools.
