The project aims to establish an overarching data pipeline and workflow using DataJoint for a multi-lab collaborative large scale microscopy neuroimaging project, aiming to define/expand mouse brain atlases using machine learning approaches. As a core component of the project, Neuroglancer will be used as the web-based, 3D visualization and annotation software. To this end, Vathes is committed to develop and support toolsets for seamless integration between DataJoint and Neuroglancer.\""],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AAAA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
