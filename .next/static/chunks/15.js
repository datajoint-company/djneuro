Walker visited the Moser group (2014 Nobel Laureates) at NTNU [Kavli Institute](https://www.ntnu.edu/kavli/research/moser) to present on DataJoint. During the visit, Vathes reached an agreement to develop a DataJoint data pipeline that will stay synchronized to mouse and rat colony data organized and managed by [mLIMS](https://bioinforx.com/lims2/product_mlims.php). This development will allow the Moser group to have unified access to information relevant for experimental data collection and analysis through DataJoint, while at the same time leveraging well-established solutions for specialized data entry and management, such as the animal colony information handled by mLIMS.\n&nbsp;\n![alt text](./static/posts/Vathes-Conducts-a-Two-Day-Workshop-for-the-Moser-Group/MoserLabVisit.jpg \"Group photo with the Moser Lab\")\n\n<!-- more -->");
